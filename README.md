# DFL_test
This repo contain code to run a test for the smallest detectable frequency difference between two tones. The baseline/reference frequency and number of trials can be adjusted. The test is adaptive to the given response per trial, i.e becomes more difficult until failure.

You can run the test in the online p5.js editor here: https://editor.p5js.org/nipix19/sketches/Hgs9L-dtA

Test results are downloaded as CSV. You can also download the javascript in zipped in this repo.

DFL.r import the resulting CSV file and produce i figure like the one below based on the results
